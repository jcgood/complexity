WALS-APiCS complexity
==========

This repository contains code and data relevant to examining complexity of
WALS-APiCS features. Many files are generated from an SQL database which is not
posted here since it is not clear to me if the data is yet permitted to be
widely accessible.

Brief descriptions of each file are given below

- APiCSFeatureComps.txt: Tabular data summarizing complexity values across
WALS-APiCS features.

- APiCSLangComps.txt:  Tabular data summarizing complexity values across
WALS-APiCS languages for languages with values for most features.

- APiCSLangCompVals.txt: Specific complexity values for each APiCS features
across each APiCS language.

- APiCSWALS.r: Automatically generated output for loading into R for statisical
processing.

- calculateComplexities.py: A script for generating various files and complexity
scores for the study of WALS-APiCS patterns of complexity.

- CompDocumentation.txt: Documentation of criteria employed to determine maximum
complexity across features.

- complexity.py: A set of Python methods for interacting with the database to
generate complexity figures.

- FeatComp.txt: An output of all complexity scores across all features.

- README.md: This file.

- ValDocumentation.txt: Documentation of criteria employed to determine
complexity level across each value.

- calculateComplexities.pyc: Python-generated file.

- complexity.pyc: : Python-generated file.
